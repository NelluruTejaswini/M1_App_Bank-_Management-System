A SWOT analysis of a bank formally evaluates the financial institution's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This analysis identifies these four main elements to help upper management better leverage its strengths to take advantage of future business opportunities while better understanding its operational weaknesses to combat threats to potential growth. A SWOT analysis can also address many other scenarios, such as new business initiatives, marketing budgets or even advertising campaigns, and is a valuable tool in bank management.
